# FileSorter

File Sorter is a python script used by the UVM Tech Team to sort files after
they have been recovered by Photorec. This was first written by Travis Bartlett
but I am going to try and refine the program a little and eliminate some of the
errors that occure.

File Sorter is written in python 3 and a bash script is used to execute the
program on any UNIX based systems. The target system for this is an ubuntu
computer. To Install this program just put put it in the /usr/bin folder and
make sure it is executable.
